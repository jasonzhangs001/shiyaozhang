<p>I am an Assitant Professor in the School of Advanced Engineering, Great Bay University. Previously, I was a Research Assistant Professor in the Research Institute for Trustworthy Autonomous Systems and Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Southern University of Science and Technology. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral research fellow at the Southern University of Science and Technology, working with Dr. James J. Q. Yu. I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Hong Kong, where Prof. Lawrence K. Yeung was my primary supervisor and Dr. Ka-Cheong Leung was my co-supervisor. I received my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. I received my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA (Graduate with Distinction).</p>
